Pukete Neighbourhood House Inc,"Te Rapa Sportsdrome 43 Church Road, Pukete",,,Hamilton,3200,400000,296,"Working together, creating a sense of communityOur Vision Statement“Working together creating a sense of Community”The Pukete Neighbourhood House Inc opened its doors in 1985 in response to a University Study that highlighted the lack of social gathering places in the Pukete, St Andrews and Te Rapa area. At first the House was opened on a very ad hoc basis, but with the appointment of a coordinator the opening hours became a regular 10 am - 2 pm. The House grew in leaps and bounds and over the years has been involved in many Community events. For example, the Pukete Bridge Opening, Carols by Candlelight.A Seniors group was started that rapidly out grew the address in Cullimore Street. As did the Oscar (out of school care and recreation) Programmes, also outgrowing number 1 Cullimore Street. The Crèche that started as a small Friday Shoppers Crèche grew into a full time day care centre and the time came for the rest of the organisation to move on.  The first move was to Bryant Village in Delamere Road, in preparation for an amalgamation with the Te Rapa Sports Club. Unfortunately this was not to be and it was hoped we could stay at Bryant Village. This also was not to be and finally a place in the Te Rapa Sportsdrome was found. This will be the final destination of the Pukete Neighbourhood House.   Our current activities are advertised in our quarterly newsletter which has a circulation of 6,500.We are now open from 8.30 am to 4.30 pm (Office) and our Oscar Programmes run from 7 am to 6 pm. It seems we are set for another 20 years of Community Development!"

Our work will assist such families and communities. We will work with other agencies who are active in the same fields.We will work in holistic ways …because Presbyterian Support acknowledges a dimension to human experience which is deeper than the individual.

Lifeway Youth Trust,20 Goodall Road,Snells Beach,,Auckland,920,200000,O50,"The focus & purpose of Lifeway Youth Trust Inc is as follows:Lifeway Youth Trust Inc is a non profit charitable trust.Programs run by the trust are aimed at influencing and mentoring a wide array of the community as a result enhancing the lives of people in the community•Children•Teenagers•Youth at risk•Solo mothers/mums•Families•FathersWe aim to do this through various means some of these are listed below:1.	To mentor youth from a young age through home visits, day trips, camps, activities & teaching. The youth are visited by leaders with high character that display honesty & integrity. The leaders that visit them have dedicated their lives to serving youth and their community2.	Work with families by providing financial relief and aid (e.g. food parcels, accessories required for day to day living) to families within the Mahurangi East community, and Rodney District as resources allow. Lifeway Youth Trust also promote and work to encourage better relations between youth and their parents3.	To provide after-school events and youth programs that incorporate teaching and training for Rodney District youth that promote young people to live life with integrity, honesty and to reach their potential.4.	To be the host (while partnering with local Council and businesses) of positive community and family based annual events that build community spirit and identity within the Rodney District.5.	Work in schools teaching anti-bullying and life skills in low decile areas the program is called KidsLife. Currently focusing in the Rodney District up to Wellsford. With the hopes to provide a national program. Many children have never been taught any life skills and we have decided that our young people need to learn about honesty, respect, self belief etc.BENEFITS OF LIFEWAY YOUTH PROJECTSThis has been outlined above as well in the program descriptions. But the overall benefit of Lifeway Youth Trust is that we are a multifaceted community organization. Lifeway Youth is focused on children and youth but we also realise that they are not the only part of our community hence why we focus on a larger part of our community as well  – children, teenagsers, young adults, parents, solo mothers/fathers and the elderly.Some of the benefits are as follows: •	Young people are gaining skills of how to be an honorable person in the community eg learning leadership skills, about integrity, perseverance, honesty etc. These characteristics are sorely lacking in our nation.•	Children are encouraged and mentored from a young age through our various programs and home visits. They are taught about making aims and having big dreams. If a child can have an aim and support they are more likely to stay focused on this rather than being led by others into areas of trouble eg under age drinking, dropping out of school etc•	Parents are supported resulting in families being more functional, abuse levels dropping and positive parenting rising in our community due to stress levels etc dropping. Due to the time and relationship that we have with parents we have them contacting us to help with their children etc. This is a great benefit that Lifeway Youth has that we build relationship with people rather than just run large events. •	Elderly are entertained through our community projects, events and visits to elderly homes.Lifeway Youth Trust is dedicated to our community and serving other people how ever we can – we view this as the largest benefit by being available to our community however we can."

Educators and staff model appropriate behaviours by building positive reciprocal relationships using positive behavior techniques.We have caring and professional educators who work as a team by noticing, recognizing and responding to children’s individual and group learning by documenting, making connections and revisiting their learning with them.  Educators use Assessment for learning by reflecting on children’s learning dispositions and Te Whariki- New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum.  We believe it is important to work in partnership with children and whanau to provide the best possible care and education for everyone.  We observe and plan experiences which extend on children’s emerging interests as these are relevant to their lives and also provide opportunities to involve the community in our programme.We believe that children learn alongside others in Bicultural and Tuakana/Teina relationships and these opportunities will be fostered in an environment that caters to their interests and strengths.   Infants will be supported with patience in reaching their developmental milestones in life and will never be put into a position which they cannot get into by themselves.We recognize the cultural heritage of Aotearoa and are committed to incorporating bicultural practice and the principals of the Treaty of Waitangi in our Centre.  We believe that cultural heritage is an important part of children’s sense of belonging; therefore we provide opportunities for them to experience their own and other cultures.Our educators and staff are committed to professional development to support children and their own ongoing learning journeys. Reviewed August 2009"

Northland Playcentre Association,6B Herekino Street,Whangarei,,Whangarei,140,311560,32,"Playcentre Philosophy StatementThe Playcentre movement recognises that children reach their full potential most successfully when their parents, caregivers and whanau understand their development and take part in the learning process.A Northland Playcentre is run by a group of parents, caregivers and whanau living in a community. Parents, caregivers and whanau work on a co-operative basis, sharing the responsibility for establishing, organsing, supervising and maintaining the Playcentre. Parents, caregivers and whanau remain fully responsible for the education of their pre-school children. There is a reciprocal learning relationship between home and Playcentre. As a result of participation in Playcentre, the parents, caregivers and whanau enriches family living : as a consequence of the experience of caring for a child, the parents, caregivers and whanau enrich the learning of children.The Playcentre movement does not subscribe to age or ability groups at the three and four year old stage. By planning the range of material carefully, we find that children of different ages can use the same basic material carefully; we find that children of different ages can use the same basic material at different levels, according to muscular ability and concentration. Younger children watch and imitate older ones and this is in most cases speeds the rate of learning and speech development. Members of one family can be together if they wish.Northland Playcentre acknowledges Te Tiriti o Waitangi as the founding document of Aotearoa/New Zealand. The commitment to the treaty reflects for Playcentre the unique place of Maori as Tangata Whenua and the principle of partnership inherent in Te Tiriti O Waitangi. We recognise this by the information of Te Roopu Whakaaro Kotahi which is made up of Maori representatives from Centres. We aim to support and strengthen Maori Whanau by focusing the resources of our Roopu to educate, promote and encourage Tino Rangatiratanga/Maori sovereignty."

The Trust works in partnership with Wellington City Council, and raises funds from other trusts with Wellington links, public and private businesses as well as many individuals, through donations and sponsorship arrangements. To date the Trust has been associated with thirteen sculptures in the city, five in the Botanic Gardens, four on Cobham Drive with three more planned before the end of 2009.Wellington City Council plays a significant role. It provides most of our sites, helps supervise the installation of sculptures, and becomes the owner and caretaker of the sculpture on behalf of the city and the Trust.The sculptors and sculptures are selected in several ways depending on the project. The Trust purchased Chris Booth’s Peacemaker to mark the centenary of the Botanic Gardens and Phil Price’s Protoplasm for Lambton Quay. It jointly commissioned Neil Dawson’s Ferns, with the New Zealand International Festival of the Arts. It called for expressions of interest from sculptors for the Botanic Garden sculpture walk project and four of the works in the city. Separate competitions were held for the Meridian Energy Wind Sculptures and the Lambton Quay Sculpture Project.The Trust has a panel of arts professionals who assist in the selection processes. The panel currently comprises arts practitioners, the director of the City Gallery, curators and an architect. Urban design and public safety advice is provided by the Wellington City Council’s liaison officer.The Trust also has honorary advisors separate from its arts advisors to broaden its resources.

Tom, an ex -naval search and rescue diver, came up with the idea of providing humanitarian aid in an easily transported box. In 2000 the Rotary Club of Helston Lizard adopted ShelterBox as their millennium project with the first boxes being sent to Gujarat in India after a massive earthquake.Since then Rotary clubs all over the world have responded by supporting the project and as of July 2010, ShelterBox has responded to over 100 emergencies in some 80 countries, sending out over 95,000 boxes, providing shelter to over 1million people. What is a ShelterBox?A ShelterBox provides shelter and warmth for up to 10 people for a prolonged period. Each box is uniform in size, and normally contains a 10 person tent, 10 sleeping-bags, a multi-fuel cooker, eating bowls, etc., and ancillary equipment such as water purification tablets, a treated mosquito net, spade, small tool kit and a children's activity pack – all the essential basics a family would require after losing everything in a disaster. The contents can and are often varied when requests are received from aid agencies or when the boxes are being dispatched to tropical areas.

Pulse and rhythm are found in the heartbeat, in breathing and movement. Pitch and rhythm give the voice expressive and communicative qualities. This inborn responsiveness to music exists regardless of disability, injury, illness or circumstances, and is not dependent on musical training or background. It is out of this innate responsiveness to music that music therapy arises.Each week the staff at the Raukatauri Music Therapy Centre work with more than 100 children and young people with special needs. These children have autism, developmental delay and learning difficulties, mental health issues, behavioural problems and intellectual and/or physical disabilities, and many are severely affected. In music therapy sessions, each child experiences music improvised uniquely with and for them. They interact and communicate musically, expressing themselves in whatever way they can - using their body, voice or musical instruments. Music therapy focuses on the client's strengths, which can make it a particularly engaging and motivating experience.Music therapy can reduce a sense of isolation, help develop new skills that can be transferred to other aspects of life, and create new possibilities for participation in the world. Through music therapy, children and young people are able to make huge gains, such as: improving motor skills and speech, growing their self-confidence and self-awareness, strengthening social skills, and improving memory, behaviour, and concentration."

The value of adopting a child rights-based approach is evidenced in research and is the most effective way to bring about positive and lasting change for children, their families and communities. Our philosophy clearly states what we at Cholmondeley believe about children and their rights to be valued, consulted and enabled to build resiliency.  This approach values what children have to offer as children, ensures that they are listened to and respected, whilst the adults take responsibility for providing a safe, stimulating environment with clear boundaries and expectations where relationship building is key."

Hornby Presbyterian Community Trust,27 Aymes Road,Hornby,,Christchurch,8042,38000,400,"Hornby Presbyterian Community Trust (HPCT) is a locally grown community initiative that exists to develop resilient communities in the Hornby, HeiHei, West Melton and Rolleston through the provision of quality programmes and services. We aim to reach out to and, provide a context where we can be the hands and feet of Christ in our community, sharing His love while addressing the needs of the vulnerable and socially disadvantaged within our communityOur overall programs are based on values of care and kinship expressed in a practical manner (community care; family care - firewood, budgeting, counselling; and spiritual direction.  Our philosophy is founded on expressing social concern without discrimination of ethnicity, gender, class, culture or religion. We seek to meet the needs of people in our community holistically) including social, psychological, physiological and spiritual needs.To do this we partner with other community organisations to support existing services, provide in house programs and support. Long term our vision is to partner with local and national Government in a high trust relationship coordinating and addressing the needs of our local community, and building our communities social capital and connectedness.Our programs are designed to foster a sense of community based on community development principles by providing community spaces where people can come and share with each other, allowing them to feel that they are part of something bigger and in doing so help them find a sense of meaning and purpose. We have a vision to make our community better and sustainable long term.All of our programs are grounded in initiatives for building hope and creating strong social networks.  Research indicates that these are two key ingredients for responding successfully to natural disasters which have significantly impacted Christchurch over the last 15 months. We have to be highly adaptive to the changing state of wellbeing in our areas and the ongoing issues of post traumatic stress evident in our communities.We also partner with Youth South West Christchurch and there services to Youth in the Hornby, HeiHei Rolleston community areas.HPCT are seeking funding for the development of a Holistic Care Centre that will provide services in the Hornby, HeiHei, and Wigram areas of Christchurch and Rolleston and West Melton in the Selwyn district. This would combine the Community projects of the Hornby Presbyterian Community Trust to enable a Holistic service being offered to meet the physical, spiritual, social, and psychological needs of people forced to relocate to the west side of Christchurch and find their place of belonging. Such people face dislocation, loneliness, grief, and a myriad of other challenges.This has wider implications for church growth that are really significant. In the wake of the earthquake and the rebuilding and rethinking required, the wider Church and Presbytery are looking at setting up centralized hubs that will service a number of preaching places and worshipping communities. This gives the opportunity for a more holistic approach to ministry that is much needed in this broken city! At HPCC we are in the place where we can model this approach. This present proposal fits so well into this opportunity for the church in this region.The centre as it is now is working collaboratively with larger NGOs, the Government providers and the wider church to develop post quake support for the next five years. This support includes a community development perspective underpinned by biblical principles particularly the commandment to love your neighbor. It is a unique model in that it operates at a local neighborhood level involving collaboration across the social services sector. We have also established programmes such as community care, family care, need based services (bread, firewood, low costs and affordable Out of School Care and Recreation) over the last ten years that would also sit alongside this project, The Centre is also working with local businesses to provide staff support in the post quake environment. Presently this involves a 4 week programme designed in Australia (Stormbirds) for children 5-15 years (broken into age relevant components) which helps children process and adapt to change in a natural disaster. The programme has been piloted successfully at our Rolleston congregation.  Funding for the resources is available.  It is anticipated that this will be run at the Engineering Company’s workplace for their children, with a programme for parents running alongside that provides education about family violence. This programme is run successfully in Taranaki in partnership with Fontera.It is also anticipated that the demand for these programmes will increase – we hear anecdotally of many teachers struggling to know how to handle children in the classroom who are still traumatised.   We anticipate a demand in the schools as well as business community.The development and operation of the Centre is being overseen by Dr. Blair Stirling. Blair’s qualifications are: Dr. Blair Stirling DipMin, BTheol, DipGrad (Community and Family), PGDipCApSc (Community and Family), PhD (Social Work and Community Development); and Blair has recently graduated from the Knox Centre for Ministry Training as an ordained Presbyterian Minister.Blair is widely regarded in his field – the Otago and Canterbury Universities are constantly approaching him to apply for lecturing jobs or to do research. He is at present negotiating with them to oversee a research project about the Church’s role in the relief operation with the Christchurch earthquake (as it has been largely ignored by the media). This project is focused on church response and development in our postquake environment. Blair personally is committed to the mission and role of the local Church in our communities and offers a unique set of skills and qualifications to work in this area."

And so the Polish Association was formed on 1 March 1948 to provide a sense of togetherness and help the migrants with the transition to life in New Zealand.  From its early beginnings, the Polish Association has represented the Polish Community in Wellington, providing leadership, direction, and a place for members to meet socially and foster the Polish culture.

This is a unique advantage that NET has operated within and enables each division to deliver unique programmes to their ethnic community while at the same time developing commonality and synergy across the organisation.Actively Supports – NET’s role is to work together with the whanau, families and aiga of our clients and consumers.  Not to be the teacher or director but the catalyst and facilitator that helps to support the most important influencers, the parents and guardians, in the development of infant and pre-schoolers.Families, New Babies and Pre-School Children – NET's specific focus is on actively supporting families and parents to nurture and develop their young infant and pre-school children's health and well being.  We do this by being family and infant centred through home visits, supplying parental information, advocacy and linking families with services available in the local community.Holistic – NET’s programmes and services operate within an holistic worldview, where each family, infant and pre-school child is seen to be a part of a wider whole.  Delivering our services with this perspective enables us to ensure that the families we help have access to all the assistance and relevant information required to nurture their infants and pre-school children towards better mental health and well being.Specialised Programmes and Services – NET offers specific services that are targeted towards helping our families meet the specific needs of their young infants and pre-school children.  These services delivered within the three tikanga service include:  •	Nature, Enjoy, Teach: Early Intervention – A home visiting programme developed by NET that helps support and educate parents through regular home contact, advocacy with other service agencies and parenting information.•	Family Start - A child-centred, family focused, early intervention, intensive home visiting programme that works with families with the greatest needs, to build their strengths and capacity to ensure that their children have the best possible start in life. •	Parent's as First Teachers – A programme of monthly visits to families, during which trained Parent Educators share information, practical ideas, and give guidance as children grow and develop.•	Support Groups - Allow parents to meet and socialise with other parents, share experiences, and learn new information about child education, social wellbeing, child and family health and other support available within their local community.  •	Mum 4 Mum Breastfeeding Support Programme – this programme is a Hutt Valley DHB initiative that aims to improve the breastfeeding rates for all women in the Hutt Valley. The programme educates women in the local community to support other women to breastfeed by giving them information and education on all aspects of breastfeeding.•	Haakuitanga Haakorotanga Maori Parenting Programme - A Māori parenting skills programme that gives Māori parents understanding of, and learning in, effective parenting skills. The programme focuses on the parent's own attitudes to tamariki and parenting by allowing them to explore the way they were parented and how this influences the way they parent their tamariki. •	Increasing Participation in Early Childhood – A programme that focuses on 3 and 4 year olds accessing appropriate Early Childhood options.  This programme works with families to support their understanding of the importance of their child/ren attending quality ECE service/s and the importance of a smooth transition into school.  •	Supported Playgroups – A programme that supports families in the community to establish and develop playgroups that nurture and grow their understanding of the importance of participation in ECE."

These services are directed to the general public, i.e. schools, community groups, churches, etc, and also to those directly suffering from alcohol and drug problems and their family members.Explain how the activities of your organisation have some public benefit.One has only to open any daily newspaper to see the major negative effect of alcohol and drug problems on our community.  Whilst the government provides many direct services through the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Youth Affairs, and other services are provided by community groups such as churches and the Salvation Army, the need for both youth and adults is great.Many troubled families are unable or unwilling to access these established large community agencies for reasons of confidentiality, embarrassment or business obligations.  Capri Trust plans to fund assessment and referral services.  Referrals will be made based on best clinical practice and to both public and private service providers.  Where referral to private services is indicated, partial and full financial support may  be available on an as needed basis.An additional and equally important activity of Capri Trust will be providing qualified speakers to community groups and conducting workshops and counsellor training events.  The main focus will be a train the trainers’ concept.  Recovering former consumers and their family members with proper training have proven to be uniquely effective in helping others with similar problems.  This type of training will also provide life skills training to these former Consumers and family members to enhance their own continued recovery.  Approved candidates will be funded for these educational services without charge or on a full or partially funded basis.  Scholarships will be provided for workshops, counsellor training events, and major conferences.Continuing Care meetings and aftercare counselling services will be made available without charge for Consumers and their families who have completed treatment and counselling services as the result of assessment and referral services.   International research has shown this long term support of social rehabilitation in integrating Consumers and family members back into their community is a key predictive factor in successful addictive disease treatment.  Most publicly funded treatment programmes in New Zealand for reasons of funding do not provide long term continuing care services.  Capri Trust will fund Continuing Care services for both primary Consumers and their family members.Capri Trust is structured to provide and fund education, referral, awareness, treatment and counselling in the area of Addiction Disorders. These services are directed to the     general public, i.e. schools, community groups, churches etc, and also to those directly                  suffering from Addiction Disorders and their family members."

This is achieved through: A) careful screening and intake procedures before contact begins, B) appropriate choice ofplay activities, C) attention to detail around the venue where access is to take place and D) intervention and facilitation on the part of appropriately skilled staff. Staff are drawn from a variety of backgrounds as the success of the Optimum Supervised Contact Model hinges on their combined ability to interact and engage with all users of the service. Care for Kids is confident that this model works as it has been regularly reviewed, tested and developed in line with both local knowledge and international research. We are also very confident in the robustness of this model in that we have repeatedly seen positive outcomes for all involved.

Waikato Queer Youth,19 Ruakiwi Road,,,Hamilton,3204,90000,O50,"WAIKATO QUEER YOUTH2012MissionTo provide a safe and accepting environment for Youth regardless of sexuality or gender identity.Vision“A community that is accepting of differences and does not assume”Waikato Queer Youth was established on the 6th September 2005 as a way forward to prevent further risk of suicide and depression amongst non-heterosexual young people for the Waikato.  In 2001 the Auckland University Adolescent Health Research Group undertook a survey of 10,000 students across 114 schools called the Youth 2000 study. A breakdown of those statistics proves the link between homosexuality, depression and suicide risk. Results identified that:*15% had attempted suicide in the 12 months prior to the survey (over twice the level of their heterosexual counterparts).*30% of non-heterosexual students had thought about killing themselves.*23% reported significant depressive symptomsTarget GroupWaikato Queer Youth is committed to working for Queer Youth up to and including 24 years of age. Queer is a reclaimed word that is used to collectively describe gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, takata, fa’afafine and intersex identities.Due to the growth of the initial group of Youth Waikato Queer Youth has split the groups in age range, 13-18 are on a Tuesday night and 19-24 are on a Wednesday night.We have now extended our services to providing informative educational workshops to schools and community agencies, including educational institutions to provide ongoing support and understanding to the wider community.Waikato Queer Youth ObjectivesWaikato Queer Youth is one way to try and create a safe, welcoming and accepting environment for all our youth regardless of their sexual or gender identity. Our organization can offer an opportunity to provide a safe and informal place where young people can talk about feelings and experiences related to sexual orientation. We offer opportunities for fun and friendship and aim to develop a community spirit among GLBT young people, friends and families. We aim:*To provide hope to Queer Youth by affirming the humanity of all people regardless of sexual and gender identity.*To promote greater understanding of the needs of Queer Youth so they can lead a happy and healthy lifestyle. This includes educational resources and making accessible information in areas of Queer Youth well being.*To provide safe places where Youth can have fun and make healthy friendships.*To reach out to Queer Youth in our region and broader who suffer from isolation in rural areas.*To build the confidence and skills of Queer Youth by providing leadership opportunities (e.g.: facilitation roles, organizing events, representation on committee).*To provide information and support about homophobia and the effects of it by working to educate the wider society including parents/caregivers and/or guardians.2012/13 Review and PlanIn April 2012 Waikato Queer Youth moved into new premises sharing a property with an existing Social Service Agency who plan to collaborate practice for their Pacific Community.  We employ a part-time Youth Servcies Manager to oversee projects and further promote the growth of the organization.  A part time Educational Co-ordinator who primarily organizes and delivers educational workshops to those who request and a Youth Mentor Coordinator who esures the current facilitators are rostered for group meetings, chairs Youth Mentor meetings and communicates with upper management with the training and developmental needs of our volunteers.In 2012/2013 we are wanting to create a Transgender/Agender support group along with Parents of Queer Kids group, the idea is also to start referring to counselling services such as LifeLine to provide the next level steps to supporting group members needs.Waikato Queer Youth have also become part of a community group called POSH, Promoters of Sexual Health, that incorporates all sexual health groups, agencies and organizations within the Waikato and Thames/Coromandel area to try and target the educating of sexual health issues pertaining to our Youth.  A primary goal for the next six months for Waikato Queer Youth is to network and become a known aspect of our local community to ensure that we reach those in need of support, Youth and parents alike.Waikato Queer Youth would like to continue providing the current services in the next 12 month period to our community and develop further by:* Continuing to support our Youth groups that meet every week.* Promoting our organization to the agencies in rural areas so we can meet the needs of young people who can be suffering in isolation.* Presenting the Waikato Queer Youth Action Kit in Waikato and beyond to promote our services which will provide education and training to start Queer Youth groups in the area. The training will provide clear and specific guidelines to use the action kit so every Queer Youth group in our region is a success.*  Providing the ongoing necessary support for new groups in our region.* Providing ongoing training for our young people and develop programmes so numbers grow in the Queer Youth community.* Training programmes to develop clear ethical boundaries when dealing with complaints, referrals and other agencies.* Providing information about events and opportunities that become available for our Queer Youth so they can be empowered in the future.* Providing training for employees and volunteers to support other Queer Youth such as developing a mentoring systems.* Providing a regular place of contact for young people struggling with sexual identity and feeling isolated.* Providing information about support groups available in the Waikato, Thames/Coromandel and Bay of Plenty region.* Advocating for a Queer Youth when necessary.Outcomes: who will benefit* Our own premises with drop in times will continue to empower young people to have a sense of belonging and togetherness.* Increased networking and promotion will create greater public awareness of how to support Queer Youth. It will create easy access for guidance, referral, structure, resources and advocacy.* Young people can gain empowerment and continue to think about long term goals.* Training will provide opportunities for professional development and grow confidence. * Young people can become positive role models for others “coming out” in the future.* The services will continue to provide a safe environment for Queer Youth where they can grow as individuals and achieve their goals. * Queer Youth in our region will benefit because we are reaching out to Queer Youth in isolation providing a safe haven which will support the wider community as a whole."

We also recognise that our bicultural heritage is founded in the Treaty of Waitangi/Te Tiriti o Waitangi and that our children need to experience the languages, music, art and stories of the cultures of Aotearoa. We believe in the importance of the whanau and respectful partnerships between home and the Centre where our families/whanau feel comfortable discussing their hopes, joys, aspirations and concerns for their children with their child’s whanau teacher. The sharing of children’s achievements and assessment of the learning with whanau is key to the whanau teacher’s role. We welcome our families into their Centre at any time of the day to spend time with their child/ren.Our outside environment is large and distinctive where all children interact. It provides vast opportunities for children to explore and develop respect for our natural environment through everyday learning. Its large grassed area full of trees, gardens, and animals encourage discovery experiences, whilst the cycle track, climbing area, sand, mud and exploration areas provide a range of experiences that promote learning limits in a supervised environment. Our teachers and parents work together to increase children’s understanding, respect and knowledge of the world and its inhabitants.We practice the concept of tuakana teina where our younger children learn alongside our older children and the nurturing of sibling relationships is important. All of our children are encouraged as confident, competent learners and communicators who develop their sense of belonging while increasing their knowledge of the community and the wider world around them.Our programme includes both large and small group experiences that challenge and extend the interests, abilities and needs of our children. A toddler support programme is in place to ensure extension, challenge and support for our young children who are approaching or in the process of transition between Centre sections. We believe that respectful, interactive relationships between children and adults form the basis of a positive self-image for each child. Our children are nurtured with warmth and caring, with a good sprinkling of fun and laughter and with hugs aplenty. By ensuring consistency, having clearly defined limits and expectations, and routines that are predictable, the children’s self esteem, physical confidence and independence are enhanced.We are committed to ensuring our staff participate in ongoing professional development, and encourage supportive team relationships where knowledge is shared and valued. We will continue to maintain a high level of trained and registered teachers, ultimately ensuring a quality teaching and learning environment is offered."

Without the ability to shoot competently, accurately and safely, as well as setup and improve the accuracy of a rifle, the main objective of deerstalking cannot be achieved effectively, safely or humanely.Range shooting on our rifle range under NZDA rules is designed to teach, practice and develop good shooting skills and instill safe firearms handling practices. Silhouette shooting is one of these disciplines where small metal target that must be knocked over. The shooter must shoot from a prone, sitting, kneeling or standing position, which are common to all NZDA shooting disciplines, as they are frequently used when hunting. Silhouette shooting is also good for teaching young, novice or woman shooters, due to the use of smaller rimfire rifles (low recoil) and the lower cost of participation.Our Branch also runs NZDA HUNTS hunter training courses to teach new or novice hunters safe firearms handling and hunting skills. Trainees are taught all of the basic hunting skills to become competent, safe, ethical hunters, includes firearms safety, bush craft, personal risk management, stalking techniques, harvesting skills, survival and first aid, environmental care etc. These courses culminate with experienced members taking the novices out on hunting trip to consolidate what they have learnt on the course, as well as impart their own knowledge and experience.In summary, our Branch exists for the primary purpose of deerstalking and all of our range shooting activities are ancillary to this primary purpose. They are the means by which the valid charitable purpose of deerstalking is achieved."

Hillary Himalayan Trust,"Level 6, 57 Symonds Street",Grafton,,Auckland,1010,300000,910,"In a spirit of friendship and partnership, the Hillary Himalayan Trust works with the peoples of theNepal Himalaya to realise their educational, health, economic and cultural aspirations.BackgroundSir Edmund Hillary founded and led the Himalayan Trust from 1960 until his death in 2008.We follow in his footsteps. He received his first request for a school in Khumjung in 1960 and sixmonths later he had built it and placed a Sherpa headmaster in charge. This set the pattern. Edlistened to requests from local people, consulted with them, then in partnership with themimplemented the project. Every year Ed trekked for weeks or months in the areas of his aid work,evaluating what had been done and working for the future. This is the pattern we strive foralongside our Nepali friends and partner organisations.When Ed Hillary built his first school in Khumjung in 1961, village people in Solu Khumbu were almost entirely illiterate. Through the development of schools, many of them built by the Himalayan Trust, Sherpas have acquired the literacy that gives access to jobs in businesses and the professions.EducationA problem identified within schools in the 1990s was the low level of teaching skills and this led to the Teacher Training Programme which has become a model for many similar projects.Early mountaineering expeditions passing through Khumbu were mainly aware of the extraordinary strength and endurance of their Sherpa porters but when Ed was accompanied by doctors in those early years they pointed out such preventable health problems as goitre, cretinism, hypothyroidism, smallpox, measles, neo-natal tetanus. Antibiotics could save many lives in young children. Care in pregnancy could help prevent maternal deaths. Much tuberculosis was treatable.HealthBuilding Khunde Hospital was the first step towards filling these gaps and this was followed by Phaplu Hospital in 1975. Nepali doctors have been trained to run these hospitals. They still receive outside financial support, Khunde from Canada, Phaplu from Germany. An important programme has been that for improving maternal and child health.CultureVisitors to Nepal fall in love with the country and its people, and what can broadly be called its culture. Nepalis can sustain their own cultural treasures but occasionally the Trust has been asked to help. The rebuilding of the burnt out Tengboche Monastery, or of a subsiding Thame Monastery, are situations where foreign finance has helped. Ed Hillary and his friend Dick Blum of the American Himalayan Foundation have been at the forefront of these projects.EnvironmentVegetation grows slowly at high altitudes. Once cut and burnt for cooking or warmth, it is hard to replace. The Trust began a forestry project in 1980 and eventually identified the altitude band between 3500 and 4000 metres as one where reforestation can be successfully achieved. Two large nurseries were developed to grow seedlings, mainly pine and fir. These were at first planted out within fenced enclosures but later it was found easier to use carefully selected sites where damage by grazing yaks and wild thar was minimal. The result has been a green belt where previously there was only sparse cover. Above 4000 metres there is a need for porter lodges and rules forbidding burning of juniper scrub or the cushion plants found at highest altitudes. Hydroelectric installations, the largest built by Austria, are making an important contribution.Disposal of garbage and human waste is now well controlled by the Sagarmatha (Everest) National Park."

Marlborough Falcon Conservation Trust,3 Russell Terrace,,,Blenheim,7240,45220,355,"The Marlborough Falcon Trust is a volunteer-run charitable trust dedicated to the conservation of the New Zealand falcon in Marlborough and nationwide. Our vision is of a thriving Karearea population, numerically restored throughout Marlborough’s various natural and man-managed habitats. Our view is that heightened public awareness of the NZ Falcon is critical to not only ensure understanding of this over-looked native treasure but to eradicate persecution and ensure successful co-existence. We see the story of the NZ Falcon’s recovery and our programme as providing a highly visible opportunity for promoting wider conservational advocacy.The Marlborough Falcon Conservation Trust has two main focuses; 1) Breeding Programme and our Legacy, 2) Education and AdvocacyBreeding Programme and our Legacy.The MFCT cares for a small population of injured or otherwise unreleasable New Zealand falcons in our custom-built aviary complex. We currently have three pairs of breeding falcons. We aim to release the offspring from these falcons into the wild so that they can contribute to populations of falcons in Marlborough. We consider the released falcons part of the conservation ‘Legacy’ in Marlborough, and hope that these falcons and their offspring will continue to help falcon populations in the region survive for generations to come. The MFCT also supports landowners who continue to feed Legacy falcons in the wild by providing them with food and a network from which to gain advice. Education and Advocacy: One of the main problems for falcons in New Zealand is that most people do not know how important they are, and some people actually shoot them! Our goal is to make the falcon one of the most well-known animals in Marlborough. Through our education programmes and advocacy work, locals and visitors get the chance to admire the beauty and power of the falcons, and become aware of the important role that falcons play in natural ecosystem functioning. Our annual school programme is conducted in conjunction with DoC, and visits local primary schools with an audiovisual presentation and a live advocacy falcon. In three years more than 2000 children in Marlborough have not only learnt about New Zealand’s only endemic raptor, they have also got to see one up close. The response has been phenomenal, with dozens of schools keen to take part in the annual awareness programme. We also visit local community groups, take part in events such as the Marlborough Wine and Food Festival and Rural Education Activities Programme (REAP) field days, and coordinate open events for members of the public to see falcons up close such as our ‘Falcons in the Forum’ days in central Blenheim."

It teaches values that will not only help each child to grow into confident, connected young people, but will improve the social life of communities around New Zealand.  Kiwi Can has had measurable success in reducing bullying, truancy, and anti-social behaviour in schools.  It also fosters a strong sense of national pride in New Zealand and unites the multicultural society we live in.Our Trust employs 20 Kiwi Can Leaders to teach full-time in low decile South Auckland schools. These leaders teach life skills in 11 primary and intermediate schools reaching over 6300 students each and every week. The grant helps us to continue our programme, which teaches children to make GOOD life choices when surrounded by some bad role modeling in their communities. We aim to help these 5-12 year old to believe in themselves and to never give up on their dreams. The Kiwi Can Leaders themselves are a key part of the programme. They provide a positive male and female role model over and above that of the students’ classroom teacher. Their role is to encourage, inspire and motivate children who are often without any such support in the home.  The example Kiwi Can leaders give to the children is that, if, given a chance, and with the right attitude – the “I can” attitude – an individual can take charge of their own life and contribute to society."

The programme helps lift their selfesteem and in the latter years of primary and into intermediate school give them the knowledge about substances will help them make “smart life choices” when confronted with these issues. The lessons are given in a mobile classroom, which is brought to each school for a number of days to several weeks, depending on the size of the school.Life Education is a nationwide organisation, with some 40 local Trusts all over New Zealand.Our Mobile Classroom with its star lit ceiling, smell generators, big screen, pull apart torso and other electronic marvels allows us to create a little bit of Hollywood in our presentation and really helps make our messages sink in. Harold our mascot is absolutely adored by the kids and our specialist Educator (two fully qualified teachers, our only paid employees) increases the effectiveness of our presentation more so.On the North Shore we have been teaching these lessons for 20 years now. In 2013 we will see nearly 14,000 children benefit from our programme. Our programme is in such demand from schools that we have had a waiting list of schools that we could not see until a recent successful fund raising effort by the Trust, has put us in a financial state where we can now afford to run two classrooms. This funding has come from local businesses (including three transport companies who move our mobile classrooms free of charge from school to school), Albany Rotary, the Lion Foundation and the Lottery Grants Board. Funding wise, the Trust charges children a token $5 or less per lesson and our actual cost is in the region of $15 - $17 - as such we need some $150,000 per annum in cash or services to run two classrooms on North Shore. This is not an insubstantial sum but one that we as Trustees (all volunteers) see as money very well spent in helping our young children make “smart life choices” when they are confronted with the many important decisions they must make in their developing years."

This provided the centre with a management structure and the Samoan staff, who had volunteered previously, became employees.In order to comply with the Ministry of Education's requirements, our licensed childcare teachers attend regular on-going training to build up on their knowledge base.The centre now runs a professional operation catering to all ethnicities in Tokoroa, teaching early childcare and education to young children from ages 6 weeks to 5 years while also fully incorporating the Samoan culture.  Currently our roll is at its maximum level, with approximately 30% of the children from actual Samoan families.A summary of our philosophy is that every child in Aotearoa/New Zealand has the right to receive high quality education and care which supports and compliments their family life.We are one of a few Samoan centres in the North Island and the only one outside of the Auckland area."

Ruapehu Community Support Trust,c/o Taumarunui Police Station 10 Turaki Street,,,Taumarunui,3920,20000,406,"The Ruapehu Community Support Trust became an Incorporated Society in 2008 and we received our Charitable Trust Status the following year in 2009.  We now have a committed governance committee made up of 7 community members including 2 staff members from the Taumarunui Police.  The Trust actively support under their umbrella three community programmes and a one off project which are;o	Te Whakakotahitanga Domestic Violence programme, which has proven its credibility and supported the Trust to gain a High Trust Provider Status, this is given to providers who have always completed their contracts on time, within budget and met all of the requirements of the funder.  This programme is financially stable for the next couple of years and is thriving from government funds.o	D.R.I.V.E Youth Mentoring Programme has been in existence for just over a year now and was created to decrease youth offending, to decrease young people’s use of alcohol and other drug use.  A component of this programme involves a group of volunteer local people from all backgrounds that offer their support of 1 hour a week to engage with one of these young people and their families that have come through the Justice system and with a guiding hand the hope is to prevent these young people from re offending.  This programme has been very prudent with their funds to last them throughout the year.o	Ruapehu Neighbourhood Support is to help make neighbourhoods safer and reduce crime. It is supported by the Police, who have a collaborative working relationship. The programme assists individuals and communities to set up groups, a coordinator then liaises with the group providing information and advice and acting as a conduit between the community and the police. Neighbourhood Support has proved effective throughout New Zealand, reducing crimes and ensuring people know their neighbours and look out for each other, this could be urban, rural or the business community. We have also had great success in Taumarunui, through NS groups we have identified scams and detected burglaries. Since starting in November 2009, we have had positive interest and membership now stands at 846 including the business community.  Working outside of core business Neighbourhood Support played a big part in the development and completion of the Community Beautification Mural painting, beautifully painted on the wall opposite the ANZ Bank in Marae street here in Taumarunui and painted by a group of young people who were mentored through the process and supported by our Ruapehu Neighbourhood Support Coordinator, whom is well known for her artistic ability and encompassing her programme to involve our local young people to be seen as volunteering their time and commitment to beautify and discourage tagging in our community.  The mural project proved so successful that we are sourcing more support to develop similar projects for our young people in the future.The Trust has reflected on last year’s achievements and applauded the three programme Coordinators for their efforts. The Trust has come together early this year and has committed their time to keeping these programmes progressing forward and developing further, Te Whakakotahitanga and D.R.I.V.E are financially sound for another year, but the Trust has identified the need for more financial support for Ruapehu Neighbourhood Support.  Core business is growing, but grants and sponsorship is becoming less each year.  To enhance the membership of the programme, the Trust has initiated a 2 year project to manage the house keeping of our membership records. We are currently researching a workable database that will be user friendly to keep accurate information on the number of members we have, but more importantly to keep information at hand of our elderly community and the more vulnerable members living on their own, this would be perfect to support in the case of any Civil Defence Emergency and has come to light due to a spate of burglaries during the festive season with many of the victims being the elderly, and very recently several serious incidences causing a panic amongst the whole community and especially our elderly residents within our township. When this resource gets up and operating we will be able to follow up on our elderly and vulnerable members with a phone call, email and even a visit to enlighten them with our support on behalf of the Police and their families. At current we keep all our records on a spreadsheet, with minimal information/ not stating their age or even if they have health issues and importantly if they live on their own, we hope to source a system that will provide this information at a push of a button. We can trial this with existing members that we already have and let it develop from there."

Tuatapere Hump Track Ltd,31 Orawia Road,,,Tuatapere,9620,330437,354,"The Tuatapere Hump Ridge Track is a 55km, 3 day loop walk that takes trampers along the south coast of New Zealand, up to the sub-alpine zone of the Hump Ridge, and over historic viaducts in the heart of native forest. The highlight is a loop track at the top of the Hump Ridge range which winds around soaring limestone tors and offers panoramic views of south-west Fiordland, the Southern Ocean, and Stewart Island. The two backcountry lodges each provide a unique stopping point along the walk. At almost 1000m, Okaka Lodge is the highest point on the track. Port Craig Lodge, at sea level, offers trampers the chance to soak weary limbs in the Southern Ocean and see the rare Hectors dolphins.  The Tuatapere Hump Ridge Track is a private walk, operated by a community based Charitable Trust. We are committed to the long term wellbeing of the environment and sustainable practises. The track’s point of difference lies in both the variety of scenery (beach walks, native bush, sub-alpine scenery, historic viaducts, sites of historic interest) and in the upgrade options it offers to all trampers (heli-packing, showers, premium rooms, track transport). Both lodges have a fully licensed bar and we also offer non-walkers the option of being helicoptered to the lodges so they too can enjoy our wilderness and join their walking group or partner. Our lodges are fully wheelchair accessibleThe very existence of the Tuatapere Hump Ridge Track is something quite special, a reflection of Kiwis' love for tramping and the 'can do' attitude of a small rural community. The track was conceived by the townspeople of Tuatapere and then built with the same pioneering spirit and hard work that built the timber town itself.The idea for a new walking track was first mooted in 1988 in the wake of mass closures of the local sawmills, and as a response to the need to generate community income. A charitable trust was formed to build the track and facilities, raising over three million dollars and obtaining permission from private land owners and the government. After many years of red tape, the track itself only took nine months to build and was opened in November 2001 by Prime Minister RT Hon Helen Clark. Many community members donated and continue to donate hundreds of hours to the track’s upkeep and maintenance. Around 25,000 community volunteer hours went into the track’s construction and another 20,000 since it opened for track maintenance. This included building the 11km of boardwalk in three metre lengths at a local woolshed during the evenings for 12 months. Every piece of boardwalk has netting on it, stapled by hand by volunteers. The track is still run and maintained by the Tuatapere Hump Track Charitable Trust, whose members are all volunteers from the community with a passion for the track and the future wellbeing of the Tuatapere community.The Tuatapere Hump Ridge Track is a model of sustainable practices and continues to pride itself on being locally run and supporting local individuals and organisations. The only privately operated walking track on Department of Conservation land in NZ, the Tuatapere Hump Ridge Track is (and offers) an absolutely unique experience and prides itself on its ethos of sustainability, enjoyment and integrity.The Tuatapere Hump Ridge Track is committed to long term wellbeing of the environment and Tuatapere community. We also encourage the public to get involved in our conservation projects and run a sponsor-a-stoat-trap scheme. Any future profits made will be returned to support local community projects. Our environmental efforts have resulted in us being awarded both Enviro Gold and a finalist in the Ministry for the Environment’s 2012 Green Ribbon Awards (Small Business Leadership category). We have had Qualmark accreditation since 2010.An extract from our current Business PlanThe main objectives of the Tuatapere Hump Track Ltd activities are:Objective 1Continue to maintain walking facilities (lodges and tracks) on Tuatapere Hump Ridge Track. Objective 2Provide a unique multi-day walking experience which is recognised both domestically and internationally. Objective 3Increase the number of clients on the Tuatapere Hump Ridge Track (and subsequently visitors to Tuatapere town) from 1800 to 2000 users for the 2012/13 season, and continue this upward trend in subsequent seasons, up to a maximum of 5000 walkers per year. Objective 4To develop the guided walking packages both on the Tuatapere Hump Ridge Track and throughout Southland and Fiordland. Objective 5To maintain and promote our facilities and upgrade options as a Point Of Difference from other NZ tramping tracks. Objective 6Tuatapere Hump Track Limited operates the track as a profitable business in order to provide returns back to the Trust and community."

Auckland Youth Orchestra (Inc.),78 Seacliffe Ave,Belmont,,Auckland,622,50000,A20,"The Auckland Youth Orchestra is the premier youth orchestral institution in New Zealand. Founded in 1948, AYO was the first youth orchestra established in Australasia, designed to bridge the gap between school orchestras and adult professional groups. Since then, more than 2,500 young adults from diverse cultural and social backgrounds have passed through the ranks of the orchestra,having received expert training in orchestral playing. No other orchestral organisation or institution in New Zealand provides such a comprehensive programme to musicians between the ages of 14 and 28.Many AYO alumni can be found in leading orchestras and ensembles both nationally and internationally, teaching in conservatories, or performing as soloists and conductors.The co‐operative structure of the orchestra provides members with organisational and team building skills; engendering dedication, confidence and self‐esteem within a positive peer environment. In today’s world, this healthysocial experience equips our players with skills and a sense of achievement that will support them in whatever career path they choose. Indeed, many of our alumni are also found in business, politics and other professions.The orchestra's training role is paramount, however it has developed an extended role as a performing and touring symphony orchestra. Alongside three annual concerts at the Auckland Town Hall, the orchestra regularly presents concerts in centres throughout New Zealand attracting audiences with diverse cultural and socio‐economic backgrounds and of all ages. AYO has made three extensive tours in Australia, New Caledonia and two to North America. In August 2011, AYO travelled to Europe, being the first ensemble from New Zealand invited to perform at the renowned Young Euro Classic Festival in Berlin, Germany.The orchestra also showcases young composers and soloists. The AYO Composer in Residence project has been running for 5 years and a Soloists competition is held annually.Our vision is to inspire young people to excellence through their love of musical performance and to provide them with a wide range of cultural experiences; thus shaping our leaders of tomorrow. Not only are we training future musicians to feed into our national ensembles and orchestras but we also play an important audience development role as our members are likely to be future audiences and supporters of the arts. AYO is a healthy social experience for young people and makes an important contribution to the cultural life of Auckland and New Zealand."

Learning & Behaviour Charitable Trust NZ,9 Hewer Crescent Naenae Lower Hutt,,,Wellington,5011,1,O50,"The Learning and Behaviour Charitable Trust of New Zealand is made up of a number of people who all share a common vision, and ethos, of raising the social awareness in the area of hidden dis-orders, learning, and/or behaviour difficulties. In addition we are passionate about ensuring that those people who are otherwise unheard have a united voice.Our Mission·	Ensure young persons with any Learning Difficulties receive an education based on equity and free from discrimination.·	Create more awareness of conditions relating to Neurological differences, IE, ADHD, Aspersers and Autism etc.·	Support families and young persons with Learning and Behavioural difficulties.Our Vision·	To ensure the special learning needs of young people are identified and provided for and funded from within the education system.·	To ensure all young people with Specific Learning Difficulties can take their place by right as successful future New Zealanders.International research shows that currently in New Zealand, youth with any Learning Difficulty along with low educational achievements are over-represented in juvenile crime statistics (80%), youth suicide rates (31%) and anti-social behaviour, such as substance abuse (80%). A large percentage of prisoners (50% approx.) have also been shown to be dyslexic.New Zealand is one country that denies students in this significant special learning needs minority (10-20%) any funding or other process for identification and support in schools. The needs of this minority group are clearly not represented within Education 2000 funding. At the moment it remains the concern and responsibility of individual parents to find extra funds for assessments and remediation.The LBCTNZ believes it is the fundamental right of all students with special learning needs to have their difficulties identified and remediation support available funded from within mainstream Education.This is the priority goal of the LBCTNZ.This group of students continues to struggle, trying to achieve academically, in spite of their average or mostly an above average intelligence. They are often labeled SLOW and are once again over-represented in the ANTI-SOCIAL or DISORDERED BEHAVIOUR category of learners and may feature predominantly in suspensions, truancy, expulsions, early school leavers."

Visual Impairment Charitable Trust Aotearoa NZ,16 Marewa Street,Kew,,Dunedin,9012,50000,160,"ABOUT VICTA: VICTA was established in 2013 to address the unmet needs of the approximately 84,000 New Zealanders disabled by irreversible vision loss who are ineligible for assistance from the Royal New Zealand Foundation of the Blind. VICTA's Patron is Dame Catherine Tizard. VICTA's founding trustees are Associate Professor Gordon Sanderson (chair), Dr Don Brash, Dr Lynley Hood and Kerry Buchan. BACKGROUND: 	•	Approximately 95,000 New Zealanders are disabled by vision loss that cannot be corrected by glasses, contact lenses, medicine or surgery, and which is severe enough to impair their ability to perform the sort of everyday tasks that most people take for granted like reading, driving, and shopping.	•	Only 11,500 New Zealanders are blind enough to qualify for membership of the Royal New Zealand Foundation of the Blind. For the remainder, comprehensive, accessible low vision rehabilitation services are scant, or non-existent.	•	There used to be ten low-vision clinics in New Zealand public hospitals. Now there are only two.	•	Poor vision affects a wide range of people from infants, to school-age children, to adults in full productivity with major family responsibilities, to energetic older folk actively engaged with their businesses, professions, families and communities.	•	Currently, the most common cause of vision loss, macular degeneration, is neither preventable nor curable (but early detection and appropriate treatment can prevent blindness).	•	Irreversible vision loss is twice as common as dementia. Since the incidence of sight loss increases exponentially with age, with our growing elderly population the problem is bound to get worse.	•	People with poor vision usually live to a normal old age. Without rehabilitation, their quality of life will fall, and their helplessness and dependency will rise.	•	Among the elderly, falls are a leading cause of injury, hospitalisation and death. Without rehabilitation, visually impaired people are at much higher risk of falls than their sighted peers, and at much higher risk of being admitted to hospital or a nursing home as a result.	•	Low vision rehabilitation is cost effective. It transforms people with high support needs into independent and productive citizens.OUR VISION: A society in which all New Zealanders disabled by irreversible vision loss receive the information, assistance and support they need. OUR MISSION: To facilitate the independence, integration and well-being of people disabled by irreversible vision loss in New Zealand, and, in particular, of people disabled by irreversible vision loss who are ineligible for assistance from the Royal New Zealand Foundation of the Blind.OUR VALUES:As an organisation we believe it is important to treat all people with respect, to value a diversity of views, ideas and cultures, and to be collaborative, innovative, effective and accountable in our work.OUR GOALS:	•	To provide a voice for New Zealanders with low vision, from childhood to adulthood, in all areas of public life.	•	To facilitate the development of a range of practical initiatives to provide New Zealanders disabled by vision loss with the information, assistance and support they need.	•	To establish a strong, effective, sustainable, responsive and flexible organisation dedicated to achieving these goals.OUR STRATEGIES:	•	To seek a parliamentary inquiry into the need for accessible, comprehensive low vision rehabilitation services in New Zealand.	•	To work for the restoration of comprehensive, accessible low vision clinics in public hospitals.	•	To establish a Low Vision/High Visibility road safety campaign.	•	To develop a one-stop web resource for visually impaired New Zealanders, their families and caregivers with news, information, expert advice, daily living tips and directories of helpful products and services.	•	To seek expert advice and funding to establish VICTA as an effective and innovative organisation long term. 	•	To facilitate the provision of ratings for appliances, products and services for ease of use by people with low vision.	•	To raise funds to provide ongoing support for, and research into, all aspects of visual impairment in New Zealand."

Harbourside Kids Childcare Centre,48 Esmonde Rd,Takapuna,,North Shore,740,1100000,349,"At Harbourside Kids Childcare Centre we believe that the greatest gift we can give our children is the love of learning. When children are in an environment that is nurturing and inspiring they are instilled with a sense of belonging and they feel confident to get involved, ask questions and explore. We provide children with opportunities to enhance their sense of themselves, work alongside others and develop a positive self worth. Each day we provide new and exciting experiences for children to explore and learn through play.We have a team of qualified teachers who work alongside children and their families to make sure that there is continuity of care between their home and the centre. We recognise that routines are important to young children, especially babies, so we work with each baby’s home routine – knowing that this is the best way to help babies feel safe and secure.Auckland and particularly the North Shore is very diverse and we reflect this in our team of teachers; consisting of Chinese, Taiwanese, New Zealand, Fijian, Indian, Korean and Filipino teachers. The teachers and children enjoy learning about different cultural events and participating in different festivities in the local community.The Ministry of Education reviewed Harbourside Kids Childcare Centre in April 2012 and we received a glowing report. “Children are comfortable with teachers and demonstrate a clear sense of belonging. Teachers work closely alongside children. They are caring and affectionate and quickly respond to children’s needs and requests”. They also recognised the valuable learning occurring; “Music and movement is a feature of the centre. Attractive and colourful wall displays are good evidence of children’s enjoyment of the programme and include contributions from families”."

"Life Education Trust, Hamilton",C/- 3 Caro Street,,,Hamilton,3240,105000,B90,"The development of Life Education NZ was initiated by Trevor Grice in the late 1980s. The Life Education mission statement is: To help give the young people of New Zealand, through positive health-based education, the knowledge and skills to raise their awareness to live a fulfilling and healthy life. Three central principles underpin the Life Education approach to health education: •	To teach children how special and unique they are, to make every child comfortable with their identity. •	To show children the magnificence of the human body, its systems—using technology to demonstrate how mysterious these functions are, and stressing the body’s needs. •	To teach respect for the uniqueness of others. The Life Education approach incorporates a focus on the provision on information about health, as well as the promotion of self-esteem, and the development of skills and competencies that will support young people to make informed healthy choices. Life Education’s view encompasses the whole person and incorporates a focus on physical, emotional, social, and spiritual health and wellbeing. A key emphasis of Life Education NZ is on linking with the school curriculum. In particular, Life Education provides 19 modules that mostly connect with two of the four Health and PE curriculum strands, that is, Strand A: Personal health and physical development, and Strand C: Relationships with other people. The content areas Life Education covers are: self-esteem; social relationships; body systems; food and nutrition; and use of substances such as alcohol and drugs."

All tutors must have achieved scholarship level in the subject they teach and also be taking this subject at university.•	Robust revision material for take-home (many students struggling to achieve need outstanding revision notes to pivot their grades - most non-achievers have never been taught or have robust revision notes to underpin their success)•	Tutor Commitment - the tutors commit to support the student until the final external exam, circa 5 months; this support is via facebook, texting, personal support.  What we have found is an outstanding relationship between tutor and student - they are taking them into their universities and showing them just where they could be in just 12 months time, this has been pivotal for many.Postcode, decile ranking and substandard teaching are no longer determining factors in their success or failure:We have no paid staff.  To date, all administration, accounts etc have been on donated time.  The tutors (350+ this year) are paid just $20 per hour when they are in front of the students during programme time.  They donate the enormous hours of follow-up and support.In all, there are over 150 persons on this programme either donating their expertise, delivering or simply helping.We work closely with the Faculty of Education, Starpath and multi agencies throughout Auckland involved in the fields of Youth and Education."

The Primal community strategy focuses on three key outputs: events, leadership development and creative arts. With over 15 years experience in these fields, we have proven this focus to be very effective in training and equipping young people to live productive lives. Primal Youth aligns strongly with the Government’s Youth Development Strategy (MSD, 2004), which states the importance of ‘quality relationships’, ‘connectedness to the community’ and ‘youth participation and engagement’. We believe that through our community programmes and activities, young people are given the chance to access these models and apply them in their lives to achieve self-belief, identity and purpose.Goals:-	Commit our energy and resource to the reduction of youth suicide statistics in New Zealand.-	Establish a Primal Youth Community in every city in New Zealand where a forum is provided for one on one conversation, allowing young people to discuss their challenges in a safe, supportive environment. We also encourage youth to connect with other youth (‘young people reaching young people’) so they can create friendships and surround themselves with people who are fighting alongside them, despite facing a battle themselves. -	Battle youth Social Deprivation and gang recruitment in regional centres by creating a community of leaders and mentors to speak inspirational words into their circumstances, preventing youth from procrastinating and ‘working it out’ in isolation. -	Identify train and develop young leaders who will become role models for other young people in the future.-	Use local Primal communities as hubs to facilliate youth events that benefit the wider community in which they are based.-	Creative talents and gifts are identified in young people attending primal communities and with coaching and encouragement are developed to give them the experience and skills they need to be successful. Further information can be found at primalyouth.com/community/"

We do this in several ways including (but not limited to): provision of information in lay language, talking openly about bowel cancer and sharing our stories of diagnosis, treatment and outcome (good and bad).

It kills more New Zealanders than breast and prostate cancer combined and four times as many as road traffic accidents. •	The good news is that bowel cancer is preventable, treatable and beatable. The chances of survival for New Zealanders diagnosed with bowel cancer would be dramatically increased with improved screening and treatment and heightened public awareness of symptoms.Donations made to BBCA help us to:- ensure that people with bowel cancer have a voice in NZ- provide support for those diagnosed and receiving treatment and their families- raise awareness among the public and health professionals about the symptoms of bowel cancer and the importance of early diagnosis- promote the need for a national screening programme in NZ- promote the need for access to the best treatment options for people diagnosed with bowel cancer"

We seek to communicate its nature clearly through everything we do, from personal interactions, specialised seminars or workshops, through to television appearances and other media.Consultation: It is important that individuals, councils and organisations wanting to know more about parkour go to those who have a good understanding of it. We are available for consultations on all areas of parkour and seek to act as the first point of contact for those who wish to learn about parkour or somehow include it in a project or event.Research: The infancy of the discipline opens many doors for knowledge to be spread to practitioners and the public alike.

Throughout the world, ‘seed savers’,  and many others, have come to the wider realisation that it is not just the ecology of our food that has been compromised by industrialization. We now understand that many other aspects of our “human ecology” have likewise been compromised, and we can’t address single issues (e.g. seed saving) in isolation. Seed saving is just one aspect of the broader need to address our “human ecology” within an industrial culture.The Koanga Institute is moving its focus towards becoming  a leading centre for regenerative living.The Institute has committed to developing a campus at 96 Kotare Road dedicated to:holding our heritage food plant collectionsresearch into all aspects of regenerative* livingsharing our experience and knowledgeThrough this, we aim to ensure the long-term sustainability, and regeneration of New Zealand’s bio-diversity heritage, and to contribute towards transformation in the wider community."

There are currently 50 or more Men’s Sheds in New Zealand.The aims of the society are to be achieved by carrying out projects in the local community which may include education and mentoring of younger people, building playgrounds and equipment for kindergartens and pre-school centres, repairing toy library stock, repairing old bicycles for the poorer communities, building planter boxes and gardens for the community houses occupied by disabled persons, and many other items for the benefit of the community.A Men’s Shed fills a much need gap in promoting the health and wellbeing of men and women in the community and brings men and women together in one community space to enable them to share their skills, have some fun and the companionship of other likeminded people, work on some practical tasks individually or work together on a project that will benefit the community. They will learn new skills under experienced guidance and increase their self-worth.A Men’s Shed is also an ideal place where health professionals can gain access to men who would otherwise disregard men’s health matters.  Health professionals will be invited into the Shed to provide informational talks and basic health checks to men in their own environment.Otaki MenzShed will make their facilities available to all people regardless of their ability, background, or culture. We will work with and be beneficial to the community with particular emphasis on working with the Colleges and other educational institutions to provide young persons with some mentoring and practical workshop skills.As has already been demonstrated in many local communities, the establishment of a Men’s Shed not only enhances the lives of many individual men and women and their families, but also provides an overall benefit to the community as a whole."

te awamutu baptist church,106 teasdale street,,,te awamutu,3800,195000,1,"If I was asked the question, what is the Church at TABaptist all about, what are our aims and activities,I would say, come and have a look. What it is that I see in everyday people’s lives that come to TABaptist is a community where the broken find wholeness, the sick find healing, the lonely find a sense of belonging, the poor find empowerment, and the lost find salvation. After all that is the testimony of many who come here week after week. In a nut shell this describes a community under the umbrella of Jesus Christ, and I think we are doing okay with this.  What is our purpose? That’s simple; to reach our community with our hearts, not our theology, but our hearts. In fact that is our theology; our hearts reflect the love of Jesus that in turn reflects God’s love for the world. How do we do that? Three things spring to mind. Word, Sign and Deed; we build the community around the authority of God’s word by the empowering Holy Spirit, we reach outside ourselves in faith for the Signs of his presence in our lives, and we intentionally focus ourselves on the marginalised, the outcasts and the needy that are all around us. How would you define your church? Firstly, it’s not mine, it’s Jesus’ church, and it belongs to the community who call on his name that choose to gather here week after week. As a description of how that community functions I think I would best describe it as a place where everyone is welcome to come, where grace is really the foundational quality we live by, and where we want to grow into being all God wants from us, individually and corporately. At the front of this is our mission, to reach into our community first and foremost with our hearts. To close, if you had to label yourselves, what would that be?  Well, we are a Redemptive Community who passionately loves Jesus, and all he stands for. Which funny enough are those inside and outside the doors of the church."

A contract employee manages the residential workshops and it is planned to have a contract coordinator for an extended young writers’ programme. The centre also runs a programme of literary events and open days each year, some of which are organised to promote the writers who are resident and some of which are done engage with our local community.

Hundreds of ordinary families in the US in the early 1970s helped to develop these extraordinary skills to prepare the pregnant body to give birth and to work through the birth journey any baby takes with the mother.Families wanted:•    To have as safe a birth as possible•    To face the unknown of the coming birth with confidence•    To stay on top of and in control of their birth experience even in the most challenging situations•    To look back on their baby’s birth with pride and empowermentFamilies wanted something to do together as they made the journey from pregnancy through birth to being a mother and fathers.We share one thing in common … our human body and it is in our woman’s body that our baby grow sand out of our woman’s body that our baby comes … no matter the type of birth. Men share the same body and can easily learn skills to prepare the body to birth and skills to work alongside the mother’s efforts.Families placed the concept that all expectant parents should prepare the body for birth and learn skills to work through their baby’s birth journey into Common Knowledge Trust along with the skills. We were asked to create a resource of these skills for self-learning in one’s own home. We were asked to tell everyone thatCommon Knowledge Trust takes this mission to grow a skilled birthing population very seriously because all Pink Kit families know that we can birth better because these skills cross over all boundaries and borders of culture, race, beliefs and religions and regardless of where or with whom a woman births. And Common Knowledge Trust has carried forward the skills fathers have passed on from conception to birth and through birth into fathering.All proceeds of the sale of the resources of Birthing Better with The Pink Kit Method® go directly to further the aims of Common Knowledge Trust."
